;;; test-helpers.el --- Shared test utilities -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Minimal shared utilities for ERT tests.
;; Provides only actively-used test infrastructure.
;; Following YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - add helpers when actually needed.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)

;;; use-package Configuration
;; Configure use-package before loading any modules that use it.
;; These settings mirror early-init.el to ensure consistent behavior.

(setq use-package-enable-imenu-support t)
(setq use-package-always-ensure nil)     ; CRITICAL: Never auto-install packages

(require 'use-package)

;;; Tree-sitter Configuration
;; Tests run with -Q flag which bypasses early-init.el, so we need to
;; configure tree-sitter path here to match production environment.
;; This ensures tests validate the same tree-sitter setup users will have.

(when-let ((ts-dir (getenv "TREE_SITTER_DIR")))
  (when (boundp 'treesit-extra-load-path)
    (setq treesit-extra-load-path (list ts-dir))))

;;; Temp Directory Management
