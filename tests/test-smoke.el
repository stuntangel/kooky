;;; test-smoke.el --- Ultra-fast smoke tests -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Critical smoke tests that must pass before running full test suite.
;; These tests should complete in under 1 second total.
;; No heavy loading, no filesystem operations, no package loading.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)

;;; Emacs Environment

(ert-deftest test-smoke/emacs-version-minimum ()
  "Test that Emacs version meets minimum requirement (29.1+)."
  :tags '(smoke critical)
  (should (version<= "29.1" emacs-version)))

(ert-deftest test-smoke/lexical-binding ()
  "Test lexical binding is enabled."
  :tags '(smoke critical)
  (should lexical-binding))

;;; Directory Structure (no I/O, just checks)

(ert-deftest test-smoke/elisp-directory-exists ()
  "Test that elisp/ directory exists."
  :tags '(smoke critical)

;;; Core Files Exist (stat calls only, no loading)

(ert-deftest test-smoke/init-exists ()
  "Test that init.el file exists."

;;; Minimal Module Loading (lightweight only)

;;; Runtime Dependencies (Critical)

  :tags '(smoke critical)
