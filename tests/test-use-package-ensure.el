;;; test-use-package-ensure.el --- Tests for use-package :ensure configuration -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Tests to ensure :ensure t is never used in configuration files.
;; Packages are pre-installed by Nix and should never trigger runtime installation.
;;
;; Context:
;; - early-init.el sets (setq use-package-always-ensure nil)
;; - This prevents use-package from auto-installing packages
;; - Individual :ensure t overrides this global setting
;; - This causes errors: "Failed to install X: Package 'X' is unavailable"
;; - Packages ARE correctly installed by Nix, but use-package tries to install them again
;;
;; Solution:
;; - Remove all :ensure t from elisp/*.el files
;; - Rely on global use-package-always-ensure nil setting
;; - Nix provides all packages at build time
;;
;; This test suite validates that no :ensure t remains in the codebase.
