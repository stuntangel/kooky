;;; test-runtime-deps.el --- Tests for runtime dependencies -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Tests for runtime dependencies (tree-sitter grammars, LSP servers, CLI tools).
;; These tests verify that external dependencies are properly configured and available.
;;
;; Tags:
;; - smoke: Critical runtime dependency checks (ultra-fast)
;; - fast: PATH and environment checks (no heavy I/O)
;; - unit: Individual tool availability tests
;; - integration: Grammar loading and LSP server availability
